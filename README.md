The 3x3 Battleship Game
===============================
### Introduction ###

This is a little game, based on the classic game Battleship, in which the player attempts to find all 3 ships of 3 tiles each. An accuracy score is given at the end of the game.

### Why I Made This Game ###

This game is based on a project on Head First JavaScript Programming. I modified it to resize for different-sized screens, and to automatically reset after a game ends.
